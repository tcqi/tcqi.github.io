---

It is my honor to accompany Yuanxin to Saga. Yuanxin was invited by Prof. [Nakamura Inasa](http://inasa.ms.saga-u.ac.jp/) to present her latest research (see arXiv:2504.09988) at the [Saga Souhatsu Mathematical Seminar](http://inasa.ms.saga-u.ac.jp/Japanese/seminar.html) at [Saga University](https://www.saga-u.ac.jp/en/). We arrived in Saga by plane on July 20, and Prof. [Oikonomides Catherine](https://www.math.keio.ac.jp/coe/member/oikonomidesEng4.htm) kindly met us at Saga Airport.
