title: A trip to Saga University
---

It is my honor to accompany Yuanxin to Saga. It was our first time ever leaving China to go overseas! Yuanxin was invited by Prof. [Nakamura Inasa](http://inasa.ms.saga-u.ac.jp/) to present her recent research at the [Saga Souhatsu Mathematical Seminar](http://inasa.ms.saga-u.ac.jp/Japanese/saga-souhatsu.html) at [Saga University](https://www.saga-u.ac.jp/en/). This seminar was jointly organized by Prof. Nakamura, Asst. Prof. [Bekki Hohto](https://hohtobekki.github.io/) and Proj. Asst. Prof. [Yanagida Koki](https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=202501012520557220). I am delighted to have taken part in such a wonderful event (:D).

We arrived in Saga by plane on July 20, and Prof. [Oikonomides Catherine](https://www.math.keio.ac.jp/coe/member/oikonomidesEng4.htm) kindly met us at Saga Airport. Professors Nakamura and Oikonomides then took us to visit the areaâ€™s famous sights and treated us to the local cuisine. We were also recommended to visit the local museums and try an excellent udon noodle house.
