I am a PhD student in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Quanshui Wu](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/fa/05/c30607a326149/page.htm). My current research interests lie primarily in noncommutative algebra, Poisson algebra and algebraic problems arising from mathematical physics. I am also interested in Rubik's Cube, table tennis and badminton.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](http://math.shu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/).

## Notes
I am a person who is keen on using  $ \LaTeX $ to write some notes on algebraic topics. The following are some of my notes. There might be some typos and mistakes in these notes. Please let me know if you see one. Thanks! I should mention that we always adopt the following assumptions in these notes.

**Set-theoretical Assumptions** The axiom system used in my mathematical world is the [von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel axiom system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory) (abbreviated as NBG system, BG system or GB system) and I recognize the [axiom of global choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_global_choice). The concept of [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(set_theory)) was introduced by [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann) in 1925, [P.I. Bernays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernays) introduced the BG system in 1937, and was improved by [K.F. Gödel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) in 1940. [J.R. Shoenfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_R._Shoenfield) published in 1954 the following **theorem**: Any statement that only contains set variables in the NBG system, if it can be proved to be true in the NBG system, then it is also true in the ZF system ([Zermelo-Fraenkel axiom system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory)). Similarly, if the statement containing only set variables in the BGC system (the axiom of choice is added on the basis of the BG system), and if it can be proved to be true in the GBC system, then it is also true in the ZFC system. For a class, we can also define an equivalence relation on it. Then the notion of [equivalence classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class) arises. A basic question is: is it then possible to select an element from each equivalence class (possibly a proper class)? In this case the axiom of global choice does not seem to work. But, it is proved by [D.S. Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scott), an American logician, that this can always be down!(See [Scott's trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_trick)) That is, for a nonempty class, say $ C $, suppose there is an equivalence relation $ \sim $ on it, then we can pick an element from each equivalence class!
