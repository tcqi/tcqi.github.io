I am a PhD student in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/) of [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/) advised by Prof. [Quanshui Wu](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/fa/05/c30607a326149/page.htm). My current research interests lie primarily in noncommutative algebra/geometry, Poisson algebra/geometry and quantum group theory. I am also interested in Rubik's Cube, table tennis and badminton. [Here](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015QITI01) is my homepage on the website of the [World Cube Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cube_Association).

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in [Mathematics and Applied Mathematics](http://math.shu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Zhuo-Heng He](https://irctmt.shu.edu.cn/Portals/728/teacher/ZhuohengHe/ZhuohengHe.html).
